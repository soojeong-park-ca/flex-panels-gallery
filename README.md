### Reflection

This was another Vanilla JS project from JavaScript 30 course by Wes Bos.

Some features to highlight in this project are:

- using `flexbox` and nested flexbox to position panels and its child elements.

- using the `flex-grow` CSS property to adjust the ratio of the sizes of the panels.

- toggling the `.open` and `.open-active` classes from the panel elements to give animation-like effect with the `transform` properties.

  ```css
  .panel > *:first-child {
    transform: translateY(-100%);
  }
  .panel.open-active > *:first-child {
    transform: translateY(0);
  }

  .panel > *:last-child {
    transform: translateY(100%);
  }
  .panel.open-active > *:last-child {
    transform: translateY(0);
  }
  ```

Some new CSS tricks that I learned from this project are:

- understanding `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink`, and `flex-basis`:
  - `flex-basis`: base size
  - `flex-grow`: how to share extra space
  - `flex-shrink`: how much to shrink when there isn't enough space
